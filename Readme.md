AIM

Develop a comprehensive simulation model to accurately represent the spread of an epidemic, assess the impact of various intervention strategies, and create an interactive visualization tool to raise public awareness and aid decision-making for effective epidemic management.

INTRODUCTION

The rapid spread of infectious diseases has always been a significant concern for public health and global well-being. Recent events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have highlighted the need for accurate and timely understanding of how epidemics spread and the potential impact they can have on populations. In response to these challenges, our project aims to develop a comprehensive simulation of epidemic spread, utilizing advanced computational models and simulation techniques.

IMPLEMENTATION

This repository contains 5 Python programs along with a dataset on covid data from different countries

1. COVID Data Analysis (covid_data_analysis.py)
Analyzes COVID-19 data using a logistic function to model the growth of cases.
Utilizes numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and sklearn libraries.

2. Epidemic Simulation (epidemic_simulation.py)
Simulates the spread of an epidemic in a population using a simple agent-based model.
Implements periodic boundary conditions.
Utilizes the pygame library for visualization.

3. SIR Model Animation (sir_model_animation.py)
Animates the spread of a disease using the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model on a grid.
Utilizes numpy and matplotlib libraries.

4. Network Epidemiology (network_epidemiology.py)
Simulates disease spread on a Barabasi-Albert graph.
Implements a simple SIR model with risk perception.
Visualizes the spread using the networkx and matplotlib libraries.

5. Visualizing Information Spread (visualizing_information_spread.py)
Generates an information network from physical and virtual networks.
Simulates the spread of information on the combined network.
Utilizes networkx and matplotlib libraries.
