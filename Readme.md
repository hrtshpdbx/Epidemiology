This repository contains 5 Python programs along with a dataset on covid data from different countries

1. COVID Data Analysis (covid_data_analysis.py)
Analyzes COVID-19 data using a logistic function to model the growth of cases.
Utilizes numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and sklearn libraries.

2. Epidemic Simulation (epidemic_simulation.py)
Simulates the spread of an epidemic in a population using a simple agent-based model.
Implements periodic boundary conditions.
Utilizes the pygame library for visualization.

3. SIR Model Animation (sir_model_animation.py)
Animates the spread of a disease using the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model on a grid.
Utilizes numpy and matplotlib libraries.

4. Network Epidemiology (network_epidemiology.py)
Simulates disease spread on a Barabasi-Albert graph.
Implements a simple SIR model with risk perception.
Visualizes the spread using the networkx and matplotlib libraries.

5. Visualizing Information Spread (visualizing_information_spread.py)
Generates an information network from physical and virtual networks.
Simulates the spread of information on the combined network.
Utilizes networkx and matplotlib libraries.
